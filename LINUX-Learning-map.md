* Linux Filesystem Hierarchy (`/home`, `/etc`, `/var`, `/usr`, etc.)
* Basic Shell Commands (`pwd`, `ls`, `cd`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `man`)
* File Viewing (`cat`, `more`, `less`, `head`, `tail`)
* Editing Files (`nano`, `vim`, `gedit`)
* Users and Permissions Basics (`whoami`, `sudo`, `chmod`, `chown`)
* Package Managers (e.g., `apt`, `yum`, `pacman`)

#### 🧪 **Practice Tasks:**

* Install Ubuntu in a VirtualBox/WSL.
* Create, modify, and delete files/directories.
* Practice navigating the filesystem.
* Install and remove software (e.g., `apt install`).

### 🟡 **Level 2: Intermediate – Becoming Efficient**

#### ✅ **Goals:**

* Develop proficiency and begin automating common tasks.

#### 🔹 Topics:

* Shell scripting basics (Bash)
* `grep`, `find`, `awk`, `sed`
* Redirection & Piping (`>`, `>>`, `<`, `|`)
* Crontab and scheduled tasks
* Process Management (`ps`, `top`, `kill`, `htop`)
* Service management with `systemctl`
* File compression (`tar`, `zip`, `gzip`)
* Environment variables
* SSH basics and remote access

#### 🧪 **Practice Tasks:**

* Write simple shell scripts (e.g., backup script).
* Automate a daily log rotation with `cron`.
* Connect to another Linux machine using SSH.
* Search and extract data from logs with `grep`/`awk`.

### 🔵 **Level 3: Advanced – Power User & Admin Skills**

#### ✅ **Goals:**

* Master system administration and shell scripting.

#### 🔹 Topics:

* Advanced Bash scripting (loops, conditionals, functions)
* Networking (IP configuration, `netstat`, `iptables`, `ufw`, DNS tools)
* User and Group Management
* Disk partitioning and LVM
* System logs and journalctl
* System performance tuning
* Firewall configuration
* System security (fail2ban, auditing)
* Backups and Recovery (rsync, `dd`)

#### 🧪 **Practice Tasks:**

* Write a script to monitor disk usage and send alerts.
* Set up a secure firewall with `ufw`.
* Configure and manage users and groups.
* Set up disk partitions and mount them.

---

### 🔴 **Level 4: Expert – Enterprise/Server Side**

#### ✅ **Goals:**

* Manage Linux servers and services in production environments.

#### 🔹 Topics:

* Kernel parameters and tuning
* Systemd units and custom services
* Networking services: NFS, Samba, FTP, DHCP, DNS
* Web servers: Apache, Nginx
* Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL on Linux
* Configuration management tools (Ansible, Puppet)
* Containers (Docker, Podman)
* Virtualization (KVM, QEMU)
* Logging & monitoring tools (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK)

#### 🧪 **Practice Tasks:**

* Set up a LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP).
* Create and deploy a Docker container.
* Use Ansible to automate server provisioning.
* Set up monitoring with Prometheus and Grafana.
